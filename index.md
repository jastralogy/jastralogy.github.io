### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    I really liked Lab 4 since it involved a lot of variables and conversions.
    Personally, I thought it was fun since it kind of seemed like a puzzle to me
    for both part 1 and part 2. Part 1 used a lot of variables and simple math
    equations, which I liked since it was similar to a logic puzzle. Part 2 used
    a lot of if statements, which I also enjoyed because it helps you think about
    setting conditions in a logical way.

* Lab 5

    I enjoyed doing Lab 5 as well since it worked with defining functions in a separate
    file as well as converting variable types. Just like before, I genuinely enjoyed
    working with these as it felt like a puzzle to me. I especially liked using the
    conversions in part 2 since it made me think about which functions would need a
    conversion and what type of variable the return would be. It made it more tedious,
    but I liked the complexity of the problems.

* Lab 6

    I might be a bit biased since I am a big fan of card games, but I really
    enjoyed Lab 6. Part 1 was a simple lesson on using and understanding
    arguments. The part that I liked best was Part 2, which involved the game
    Blackjack. Although it didnâ€™t necessarily mean that we were coding an online
    game of Blackjack, I thought that the amount of conditional statements and
    logical reasoning needed in order to determine the ending value of the cards,
    especially with the Ace card, was what made it enjoyable for me.
